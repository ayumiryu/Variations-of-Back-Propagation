# Variations-of-Back-Propagation
implement the Back propagation learning for a 2 layer perceptron. Moreover, we will discuss and experiment the aspects for influencing the training, including alpha, hidden units, and stopping condition; and test the Nguyen-Widrow initialization, back propagation with Momentum.
Develop Tools: MATLAB R2018a.

### Program running help: 
1.	In the MATLAB under the files’ directory, type “help [file Name]” to get running help.
```
help [file Name]
```
2.	For restoring the training more easily, please load "mablab_7.20.mat" first to get all the initial values.
